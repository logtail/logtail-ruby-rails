module Logtail
  # The Logtail Logger behaves exactly like the standard Ruby `::Logger`, except that it supports a
  # transparent API for logging structured data and events.
  #
  # @example Basic logging
  #   logger.info "Payment rejected for customer #{customer_id}"
  #
  # @example Logging an event
  #   logger.info "Payment rejected", payment_rejected: {customer_id: customer_id, amount: 100}
